# Applying for computing and storage

Applications for computing and storage resources should be submitted through Metacenter Administration System (MAS).


## If you do not have a compute (nn) or storage (ns) project

Please refer to the information on [this page](https://www.sigma2.no/apply-e-infrastructure-resources) for more details 
and follow the link that takes you to the application form.


## If you already have a compute (nn) or storage (ns) project

To apply for additional compute or storage resources to an **existing project
allocation**, we offer a dedicated and [simplified
procedure](https://www.sigma2.no/extra-allocation).
