# Applying for computing and storage

Applications for computing and storage resources should be submitted through Metacenter Administration System (MAS).

## You do not already have a compute (nn) or storage (ns) project

Please refer to the information on [this page](https://www.sigma2.no/apply-e-infrastructure-resources) for more details 
and follow the link that takes you to the application form.

## You already have a compute (nn) or storage (ns) project

In many cases you need additional resource and there exists a dedicated and simplified procedure for applying for more resources for
either the compute or storage projects. You can reach this by following [this link](https://www.sigma2.no/extra-allocation).
