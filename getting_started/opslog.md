# Using opslog

Opslog is our status system to keep you informed about events on our infrastructure.
There you will find posts and updates regarding maintenance, incidents and general changes you should know about.
We have integrated the system with our other services to push information more actively as well - more on this below.

## Where to find it?

The main page is accessible on [https://opslog.sigma2.no](https://opslog.sigma2.no). This is the best place to get a quick overview of the overall status.

### Interacting with groups
Services are divided into groups. These are collapsed by default to save space and make the site cleaner, **unless** there are ongoing events. In such case the relevant group will be expanded.  

You can expand or collapse these groups yourself by clicking on the boxes to the left of group names.

### Banner on our websites

You may also see a pop up while browsing our other websites (like this one!) when there is an ongoing incident or maintenance.
Incidents will always have priority in case there is ongoing maintenance at the same time.

These banners follows you while browsing the same site. Click the X in the top right corner of the banner to close this specific notification. If something new is posted, it will appear again.
Clicking `"View latest updates"` will take you to the details of this event on the status page itself.
