# HPC On-boarding 18-20 April 2023

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering 
an on-boarding hands-on course for new users of HPC systems. 

The course is highly recommended  for all new users of national HPC systems 
(Saga, Fram, Betzy) and all interested in the feild.

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees of any
background. We assume no prior knowledge of what an HPC is or how to use it. For those who
have little experience with UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux or who have never
worked on the command line of a terminal, we will offer a hands-on pre-course about UNIX 
a day before the HPC course.

**The course is open to all and free of charge.**


## **Practical Information**

This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity and
pre-installed programs to participate in the video meeting of the course (zoom) and 
to access the HPC systems (eg: ssh).

You can always contact us by sending an email to [support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no).

If you want to receive further information about training events, and other announcements 
about IT resources and services for researchers, there are a couple of information channels

## **Registration**

The course is free of charge and is organised by the NRIS partners UiB, UiO, UiT, NTNU & Sigma2.
Ordinary registration closes on **14th April** so that we get enough time to ensure that everyone
 has an account on the HPC systems  in case a participant does not already have one. 
Registration is [here](https://skjemaker.app.uib.no/view.php?id=14145416).

## Code of Conduct

All participants in our course are expected to show respect and courtesy to
others. We follow [carpentry code of conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#code-of-conduct-detailed-view).
If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you either report to 
the zoom host right away or write to [the training team](mailto:training@nris.no).

## Preparing your machine for the course

We assume you have the necessary tools installed on your machine and are able
to use them. You need tools to login into a remote machine. If you
need to install such tools, please see [prepare your machine section](https://wiki.uib.no/hpcdoc/index.php/HPC_and_NIRD_toolkit_course_fall_2020#Preparing_your_machine_for_the_course). 
If you are using Windows 10 or earlier versions and you donâ€™t have a terminal to execute UNIX 
commands, you are requested to install [Git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
