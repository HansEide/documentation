# HPC On-boarding October 2022

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering 
an on-boarding hands-on course for current and future users of national HPC systems 
(Saga, Fram, Betzy). 

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees of any
background. We assume no prior knowledge of what an HPC is or how to use it. For those who
have little experience with UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux or who have never
worked on the command line of a terminal, we will offer a hands-on pre-course about UNIX 
a day before the HPC course.

**The course is open to all and free of charge.**


## **Practical Information**

This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity and
pre-installed programs to participate in the video meeting of the course (zoom) and to access the HPC systems (eg: ssh ).

You can always contact us by sending an email to [support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no).

## **Registration**

The course is free of charge and is organised by the NRIS partners UiB, UiO, UiT, NTNU & Sigma2. Registration closes on **10th October** so that we get enough time to ensure that everyone has an account on the HPC systems  in case a participant does not already have one.
