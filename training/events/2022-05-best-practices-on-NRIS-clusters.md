# Best Practices on NRIS Clusters May 2022

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering
a course for users of national HPC systems (Saga, Fram, Betzy). 
The two half days course is the follow up to the NRIS Hpc on-boarding
course. We will focus on different aspects related to the everyday usage
of HPC facilities in order to facilitate an valuable and productive framework
to develop your research. These include best practices and trouble shooting,
resource management, software installation, gpu computing with slurm and advanced 
user support 

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees
who want to deepen their knowledge of the usage of HPC facilities. This is a follow-up
course to the NRIS Hpc on-boarding course (although it is not a prerequisite). 
If you are new to HPC, we highly recommend to sign up for the NRIS Hpc on-boarding course 
to benefit from this course.

**The course is open to all users and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**

## **Practical Information**

This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity and
pre-installed programs to participate in the video meeting of the course (zoom,
might work from a browser), to access the HPC systems (e.g., ssh or Putty), to
transfer data to/from an HPC system (e.g., scp or WinSCP).

and to transfer data to/from a remote machine (e.g., scp or WinSCP). If you
need to install such tools, please see [prepare your machine
section](https://wiki.uib.no/hpcdoc/index.php/HPC_and_NIRD_toolkit_course_fall_2020#Preparing_your_machine_for_the_course).
