# Betzy

Named after [Mary Ann Elizabeth (Betzy) Stephansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Stephansen), the first Norwegian woman to be awarded a doctorate degree.


## The most powerful supercomputer in Norway

Betzy is a BullSequana XH2000, provided by Atos, and will give Norwegian researchers almost three times more capacity than previously, with a theoretical peak performance of 6.2 PetaFlops. The supercomputer is located at NTNU in Trondheim, and was set in production 24 November 2020. Betzy provides close to two billion CPU hours per year, and has a contracted operating time of four years (2024), with an optional one-year extension (2025).

Betzy has also gotten a GPU partition consisting of 3 nodes. Each node has 128
CPU cores, 512 GiB memory and 4 x Nvidia A100 GPUs with 40GB memory.
