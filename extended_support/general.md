# Extended support

Here we formulate a nice text regarding our services outside providing hard resources and support for that.

In a sales pitch sort of way maybe. And certainly as welcoming as possible to the users.

Let us try not to use e.g. AUS so much in writing, just refer to it as just a name for something useful. Also, link the following (possibly more pages) in a natural way in this text (formal resources are today: {ref}`Extended User Support (EUS) <extended-support-eus>`, {ref}`Advanced User Support (AUS) <extended-support-aus>`, {ref}`GPU Support <extended-support-gpu>`, {ref}`National Competence Center (NCC) <extended-support-ncc>`).
