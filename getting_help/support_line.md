# Support line

For support requests concerning resource applications, projects and
their compute and storage allocations, as well as for user accounts and
group memberships, please contact
[contact@sigma2.no](mailto:contact@sigma2.no) (*administrative support*).

All other support requests concerning the e-infrastructure resources should be sent to
[support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no) (*technical support*).

Behind these addresses are issue trackers (ticket system) and you will get an
automatic reply first and can expect response from our staff within hours
during normal work-hours, or at the latest the following working day (except
holidays).

When replying to email from the support line **please keep the ticket number** in
the subject line.

However, for a new problem, **do not reply to emails with unrelated subjects** (and
ticket numbers) as this can be confusing for us.

## General guidelines for usage and purpose of the support line

### What can you expect from the support line

The support line is there for the user and we encourage its usage. However, the load on the support line can
from time to time be extensive, which requires the staff working with tickets to prioritize. We ask for your understanding 
and in order to better justify the prioritization we would like you to consider that the following topics will be **defined as 
low priority** for the support line:

- Issues, questions or advice with compilations, setups, environments, executions, data preparation etc. on **local resources**.
  Please consider to raise these issues with your local IT department, support service of your organization or the place you purchased your compute equipment.

- Issues, questions or advice pertaining to software settings related to the problem you are trying to solve. Typically this 
  covers the choice of algorithms, convergence related issues, how to use certain features etc. Please consider
  to raise these issues with the developer or vendor of the software your are using.

- Issues, questions or advice pertaining to how to solve particular domain specific problems. Please consider to discuss this first with
  your research group, colleagues. If you feel alone on these problems, please consider to use the opportunity to 
  increase your networking activity and contact other persons you might not already know in order to ask or discuss these
  problems or challenges.
  
If there is capacity in the support line, the staff **might address these requests**. Please consider to first utilize local resources, 
searching the internet, establishing new contacts, attending conferences and workshops to discuss your specific problems and issues,
study the documentation and maybe the most important aspect, make sure you have done what you can to obtain basic knowledge of the
issue or problem at hand.

```{note} There are exceptions to the definitions above. We have a few application liaisons targeted towards assisting users in a few domains/softwares. For these particular domains/softwares, tickets are forwarded to the respective liaisons. Please consult the documentation pages related to the domains/softwares in order to understand what we can do for you. We highly encourage fields or groups to contribute with application liaisons in order to improve response time, usability and adoption of certain software or techniques. If so, or if you have any questions related to this, please contact us at [support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no). 

Currently we have application liaisons targeted towards the following domains/softwares:<br>
	- {ref}`VASP <VASP>`
```

### What we expect from you

We expect that, if asked, users can give details to the support staff the description of their jobs like what their jobs are doing, how they work, why they need the resources they have requested, how they use the queues and when they are expected to complete. Jobs will be removed from the queue if requests for this information are not answered clearly and in good time, especially if a job is blocking access to the queue, or otherwise limit other users access to resources.


### Give enough information

We get many requests for help which are too vague to give a useful response.
So, when sending us a question, always answer these questions and you’ll get
the fastest useful response:

- **Has it ever worked?** (If so, what has changed?)
- **What are you trying to accomplish?** (Your ultimate goal, not current technical obstacle.)
- **What did you do?** (Be specific enough to be reproducible - copy and paste exact commands you run, scripts, inputs, output messages, etc.)

If you don’t know something, it’s OK, just do your best and we’ll help from
there! You can also chat with us to brainstorm about issues in general.

Please also look at the page for a more detailed guide on [how to write good support
requests](how_to_write_good_support_requests.md) on how to report problems in
the most effective way for getting help quickly.

### Useful knowledge to possess before submitting a ticket

Being accustomed to basic knowledge about Linux command line (shell) navigation and shell scripting makes
it easier to communicate with support and will most likely make your daily work flow more efficient as well.
If you are new to command line, go through some Linux tutorials on the subject first. 
Here are some useful pages you can look into: [shell novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) or [Effective shell](https://effective-shell.com). Otherwise consult your local IT resources for help.

However, do not be afraid to contact support if you are not an expert or have knowledge of this. We will
try our best to help you.

### Display active and resolved tickets

To see details about your open and resolved support requests you can login to the
[self-service page](https://rt.uninett.no/SelfService).
There you can select a ticket to see its current status, subqueue as well as the
whole conversation.
Please note that only ticket are displayed which are sent from the same email address as the one connected to your Feide account, you use to log in.
