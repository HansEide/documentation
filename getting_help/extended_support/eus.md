# Extended User Support

For a smaller adoptions, optimisations and changes which are exceeding ordinary support, you can inquire with support staff for extended user support (formerly called mini Advanced User Support). Support staff try to identify an expert who can estimate the time and effort needed and potentially take the case.

Extended user support can also be initiated by the support staff, typically if they see that this could be of a relevance, f.ex. in connection with in-effective jobs. In such a case you will be contacted by the support staff and offered the Extended User Support.

Extended User Support projects does not require any funding or in-kind from the project or user, but will be dependent on the availability of someone from the support staff with the neccessary skills and time to dedicate. The total amount of work effort should not exceed **10 working days** or last longer than 2-3 weeks. The project that receives the extended support will be noted, and the project leader informed.

If more time and effort is needed, the likely outcome is that Extended User Support could lead to formulation of a proper AUS project, which needs a small application and evaluation, but in turn could assign a few months of dedicated work from one of our experts.
