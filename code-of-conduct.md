# Code of Conduct

On this page we list some expectations from our side and recommended practice that is significant for upholding a reliable and professional working assosiation between the user and the support staff.

## General

- We presume that you are accustomed to some basic knowledge about Linux command line (shell) navigation and shell scripting. If you are new to command line, go through some Linux tutorials on the subject first. Here are some useful pages you can look into: [shell novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) or [Effective shell](https://effective-shell.com) 

- We expect you to explore this useful documentation before asking for help.

- We expect you to use the resources responsibly. Since the resources are shared among many users, it is significant that we maintain the services that can be fair to all our users. Make sure that you have gone through  the [Slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html#lbAG), {ref}`job-types`, {ref}`queue-system`,[HPC machines](/hpc_machines/hardware_overview.md),and {ref}`choosing-memory-settings` to verify that you are submitting the right job to the right partition to the right hardware and not wasting resources.

- You are obliged to comply with [Sigma2 user policy](https://www.sigma2.no/acceptable-use-policy).
- Users should meet the terms of the [best practices](jobs/dos_and_donts.md)
 
## General Communication with support staff

-  All support requests concerning the e-infrastructure resources should be sent to [support@metacenter.no](mailto:support@metacenter.no). Please see the {ref}`support-line` for guidelines.

-  We expect that, if asked, users can give details to the support staff the description of their jobs like what their jobs are doing, how they work, why they need the resources they have requested, how they use the queueis and when they are expected to complete. Jobs will to be removed from the queue if requests for this information are not answered clearly and in good time, especially if a job is blocking access to the queue.

-  We encourage users to report if they notice any violation to this code of conduct or other misuse of the resources by sending an email to [support@metacenter.no](mailto:support@metacenter.no).

## Security

- Do not share your account password, private SSH keys or other login credentials with anyone.

## Housekeeping

- Clean up your home directory frequently to make sure that you don't exceed the quota limit. Please see [this page](/files_storage/clusters.md) for more details on usage and quota.
