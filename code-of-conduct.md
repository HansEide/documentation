# Code of Conduct

## Ethics and values

We strive to cultivate fair, efficient, professional and welcoming working environments and relationships, regardless of education, socio-economic status, gender, nationality, age, personality, religion, disability, size, appearance, ethnicity, political, identity or orientation in the sexual context. 

In all possible relations we should be honest, unprejudiced and unbiased. We should try to focus on facts over feelings without relieving possibilities to express in a proper way if need be. 

## Scope

Staff of NRIS are expected to follow this code of conduct, as is any users or other entities collaborating with staff or the legal entities that are partners in NRIS in a more formal manner.

## Standards of operation

We expect all parties to follow these standards:

- Use a welcoming and respectful tone when communicating.

- Think before you write or speak.

- Always assume the person you communicate with have the intention to help or want to be helped.

### Technical and dedicated to our specific service portfolio

In order to provide efficient delivery of services, both hard and soft, to a broad community we would like everyone to try to comply with the following:

- Do not share your account password, private SSH keys or other login credentials with anyone. Also, we assume you keep them protected by common standards.

- Being accustomed to basic knowledge about Linux command line (shell) navigation and shell scripting. If you are new to command line, go through some Linux tutorials on the subject first. Here are some useful pages you can look into: [shell novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) or [Effective shell](https://effective-shell.com). Otherwise consult your local IT resources for help.

- Use resources responsibly. The resources are shared among many users and fairness is number one priority. Make sure that you have gone through the [Slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html#lbAG), {ref}`job-types`, {ref}`queue-system`,[HPC machines](/hpc_machines/hardware_overview.md), and {ref}`choosing-memory-settings` to verify that you are submitting the right job to the right partition to the right hardware and not wasting resources. Also, make sure you have read and understood {ref}`support-line` before submitting a ticket to our front-line support.

- Do and do not do's should be followed: {ref}`for jobs<jobs-dos-donts>`

- All support requests concerning the resources, both hard and soft, should be sent to [support@metacenter.no](mailto:support@nris.no). Please see the {ref}`support-line` for guidelines.

-  We expect that, if asked, users can give details to the support staff the description of their jobs like what their jobs are doing, how they work, why they need the resources they have requested, how they use the queues and when they are expected to complete. Jobs will be removed from the queue if requests for this information are not answered clearly and in good time, especially if a job is blocking access to the queue, or otherwise limit other users access to resources.

-  We encourage users to report if they notice any violation to this code of conduct or other misuse of the resources by sending an email to [support@metacenter.no](mailto:support@nris.no).

- Clean up your home directory frequently to make sure that you don't exceed the limits. Please see [this page](/files_storage/clusters.md) for more details on usage and quota.
