# NIRD Migration User Guide    

This page is an information guide for the process of migrating data 
from old NIRD to new NIRD Storage system which is set in production
over summer 2022. 

The NIRD is redisigned for the evolving needs of Norwegian researchers 
and has been procured through 
[the NIRD2020 project](https://www.sigma2.no/procurement-project-nird2020).
 You can find the status updates in the projects page 
[here](https://www.sigma2.no/procurement-project-nird2020).

Note that the project page will be continuously updated as new information 
becomes available. Hence we recommend that you check this page frequently.
Additionally, the most important messages will be communicated by e-mail.

[The PoWG’s migration team](https://www.sigma2.no/be-ready-migrate) will 
take care of your data and services throughout the transfer to effectively 
migrate during the first quarter of 2022. However, nird project leaders/executive 
officers(PI/XO) and nird users are requested to cooperate with the PoWG team to select,
 prepare and verify the data that need to migrate.  This is crucial to facilitate 
the migration of important data.

```{note}
User home ($HOME) migration is user's responsibility.
