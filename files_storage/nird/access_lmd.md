# Access and login


## Getting access

To gain access to the storage services, a formal application is required. The
process is explained at the
[How to apply for a user account](https://www.sigma2.no/how-apply-user-account)
page.

Users must be registered and authorised by the project responsible
before getting access.

To access or transfer data, you may use the following tools: `ssh`, `scp` or
`sftp`.  Visit the {ref}`file-transfer` page
for details.

The new NIRD can be accessed via the following address

```console
login.nird-lmd.sigma2.no
```

The login credentials are the same as for the old NIRD.

You will be logged into your home area `/nird/home/$USERHOME`


```{note}
Your $HOME directory is  empty now. User home ($HOME) migration is userâ€™s responsibility. 
 The project data migration from old NIRD to the new NIRD is in the final phase. If you have
 any questions regarding the migration process and the configuration of the account on the new NIRD,
 do not hesitate to contact [the PoWG](https://www.sigma2.no/be-ready-migrate) via nird-migration@nris.no.
Once the old nird is decommisioned, the new nird can be  accessed via the same address as old nird,
 ie., `login.nird.sigma2.no`.
```

## Software access

Software access is via command line. A number of softwares are already installed
for the users. If there is any particular software need, requests should be sent to
support line.
