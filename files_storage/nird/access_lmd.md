# Access and login


## Getting access

To gain access to the storage services, a formal application is required. The
process is explained at the
[How to apply for a user account](https://www.sigma2.no/how-apply-user-account)
page.

Users must be registered and authorised by the project responsible
before getting access.

To access or transfer data, you may use the following tools: `ssh`, `scp` or
`sftp`.  Visit the {ref}`file-transfer` page
for details.

The new NIRD can be accessed via the following address

```console
login.nird-lmd.sigma2.no
```

The login credentials are the same as for the old NIRD.

You will be logged into your home area `/nird/home/$USERHOME`


```{note}
Your $HOME directory is  empty now. User home ($HOME) migration is userâ€™s responsibility. 
Please see the {ref}`nird-migration-guide` for how to migrate files from your old `$HOME`.

Once the old nird is decommisioned, the new nird can be  accessed via the same address as old nird,
 ie., `login.nird.sigma2.no`.
```

## Software access

Software can be accessed as module just like on HPCs. Please see the {ref}`module-scheme` for details.

```{warning}
Module command is not yet stable. Please report any issue encountered to support line, 
contact **[support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no)**.

```
In addition a number of software can be accessed via command line.
