The schrodinger Job Control facility obtains information about the hosts on which it will run jobs from the 
schrodinger.hosts file. This file contains many of the usual slurm parameters that you probably have seen before.
In addition, the schrodinger.hosts is used to set up the menus in the job settings dialog box in `Maestro`.
